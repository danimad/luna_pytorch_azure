# Testing out PyTorch on the Luna16 dataset

## Info

This is the repo for my PyTorch test code. I participated in the
early review of Manning Books' PyTorch in Action book, and this repo is
partially based on me following the books code exercises. Due to being an early
review version it didn't contain some parts of the code. I want to write these
parts myself, but also extended them with Azure Batch processing management,
because I don't have the necessary computing power locally.

## TODO

- [ ] Make Jupyter Notebook version control friendly
- [ ] Create automated `conda` environment setup script
- [ ] Get permission from the authors if I give a presentation somewhere of this
    code
- [ ] Write Azure provision script
- [ ] Write a script that uploads all the files to B2
- [ ] Create Azure Keystore
- [ ] Create a DL model
- [ ] Finish the DataLoader class
- [ ] Create presentation
